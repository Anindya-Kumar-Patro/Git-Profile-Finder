# Git-Profile-Finder
This is a Project made using the JQuery, AJAX and Github OAuth Key which can be used to find github profiles through out the internet


# JQuery Code Explanation
We use the id from input and with the help of keyup we take in the name thats written over the search bar. Using AJAX we provide the client id and secret key and inside the profile div we write up the HTML bootstrap code
In case you download it please use your own client id and secret key
